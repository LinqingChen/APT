London - Everyone is formed by his story , but countries fabricate reescriben and their stories .
The story of how we became who we are needs to accommodate our sense of tribal solidarity and accomplishment .
Our triumphs and virtues are exaggerated ; our villains externalized ; our failings covered up .
All of this makes the study of history is potentially revolutionary , and hugely valuable .
Good historians impel us to be honest about ourselves and destroy our autoengaños .
This is particularly true in our heroes of several faces , as we see in the Chinese Communist Party &apos;s treatment of Mao Zedong .
In October Commission 60 years of time Mao were planted in Tiananmen Gate of Heavenly Peace , in Beijing , said the founding of the People &apos;s Republic .
The time marked the beginning of years of wars and terrible hardship ; the revolution had won , with blood sacrifice , heroism , the mistakes of enemies and aid manipulator , Stalin presented himself as a friend .
The decades of rapacious war lords , greedy imperialists , and Japanese invaders were over the Tyranny Mao .
The Judgments passport-holding grandemente Mao differ .
For hard-line Communists , it was a triple hero : Historic , patriotic , and world-class .
For the brave charismatic dissident Wei Jingsheng , Mao &quot; cast virtually the whole of China into a state of violence , duplicity , and poverty . &quot;
The Communist Party &apos;s official verdict , undoubtedly the product of fierce ideological disputes , is that he was a great Marxist and revolutionary , whose &quot; mistakes &quot; during the Cultural Revolution were outweighed by their contribution to China . &quot; &quot; Its merits , it argues , &quot; are primary and his errors secondary . &quot;
In the Chinese Communist Party will not tolerate any questioning this vision .
Mao &apos;s establishment of authority over China , his injection of patriotic pride in a country that had been appallingly sundered and humiliated by external and internal forces for a century and a half , and his romantic legend as a global revolutionary leader they contribute to the moral and political legitimacy that Chinese leaders .
What they cannot win through democratic elections they acquire through history of revolution and today &apos;s economic triumphs .
But cannot be totally expunged the dark side of Mao .
People remember what happened too many her family histories .
Forget how the Great Leap Forward , which produced mass starvation and probably near 38_millones deaths .
Then the madness of the Cultural Revolution , when millions suffered terribly , many died , and many more behaved disgracefully as Mao sought to destroy those who had rescued China from his earlier follies .
Mao famously Internet biography written by Jung Chang and published in 2005 for these terrible events with a level of bleak detail that puts the Communist propagandists nervous , and some sinólogos scholars who criticize the Mao &apos;s achievements have been recognized enough .
Certainly , Mao figure is a more interesting than many other tyrants : A poet , an intellectual , a student of history as a mujeriego that his doctor Li_zhisui , particularly of Swim in water , not bathing .
I know of no better or more fascinating portrait of any political leader that Li &apos;s book , The Private Life of Chairman Mao .
I remember being told a story about China that gives credence to the Communist leadership &apos;s generous verdict on Mao .
The mother of a Chinese journalist who now live outside the country had enjoyed among those who returned after 1949 to his homeland with her husband and family , leaving behind a comfortable living in an American university .
They regarded returning as their patriotic duty .
The family sacrificed everything .
They were victims of a round after round of Mao &apos;s tyrannical campaigns against &quot; Rightists , beginning with the silencing critics after the Hundred Flowers Movement in 1956 .
The family suffered shortages and hardships , and the father died from the long-suffering maltratos during the Cultural Revolution ...
Nevertheless , the mother , because she never complained that the sacrifices of her family were justified by the release and the rise of China .
Towards the end of her life , her mood changed .
In the 1990s gave the beginning of China &apos;s economic boom in the early years of spectacular growth .
She witnessed the return of greed and corruption that she believed had destroyed the Kuomintang in the 1930 &quot; s and 1940 .
They then asked whether his family had suffered so simply to pave the way for this .
And yet China &apos;s economic renaissance - some of whose effects so disturbed this patriotic woman - has been the most remarkable event in recent world history .
Economic recovery began under Deng Xiaoping , who had survived the purge of Mao , being able to sustain its legacy and become the architect of China &apos;s rise to global power .
Over time , the hundreds of millions of Chinese have been lifted out of poverty as a result of Deng &apos;s reforms they see as a greater hero than Mao .
But , whatever Mao &apos;s terrible failings , during his years of absolute power had a sense of common purpose and solidarity that went with shared hardship .
Maoism was a curious and unique mixture of class warfare and socialist leveling , all enunciated by a man who believed that individuals - or at least himself - could shape history rather than their victims of tides and currents .
Clearly this creed has outlived its creator .
Pragmatism with a Leninist face .
The wealth of glorias deserved to overcome hardship of car patriotic sacrifice .
Mao made China sintiera to pride itself .
Deng made prosperous .
What will happen now ?
For the sake of all , I hope that the future does not derail China &apos;s economic progress , though it would be a surprise if it does not challenge its arthritic and adamantine political system .
